# mappymatch
Mappymatch is a pure-python package developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory for matching GPS traces (GPS points captured while transiting) to the route they represent on a maps. The same thing Google maps does when you are using it. Supported matching algorithms LCSS and ____. Supported map formats are OSM and ____.

## Installation 

Check out [the docs](https://mappymatch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/general/install.html) for install instructions.

## Example Usage

The current primary workflow is to use [osmnx](https://github.com/gboeing/osmnx) to download a road network and match it using the `LCSSMatcher`.

The `LCSSMatcher` implements the map matching algorithm described in this paper:

Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board 2645 (2017): 67-75.](https://doi.org/10.3141%2F2645-08)

usage:
```python
from mappymatch import root
from mappymatch.matchers.lcss.lcss import LCSSMatcher
from mappymatch.utils.geo import geofence_from_trace
from mappymatch.maps.nx.readers.osm_readers import read_osm_nxmap
from mappymatch.constructs.trace import Trace

trace = Trace.from_csv(root() / "resources/traces/sample_trace_1.csv")

# generate a geofence polygon that surrounds the trace; units are in meters;
# this is used to query OSM for a small map that we can match to
geofence = geofence_from_trace(trace, padding=1e3)

# uses osmnx to pull a networkx map from the OSM database
road_map = read_osm_nxmap(geofence)

matcher = LCSSMatcher(road_map)

matches = matcher.match_trace(trace)
```
